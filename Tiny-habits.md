## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Question 2 : How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

- Focus on ability.
- Use effective prompt.
- Leverage Motivation.
- Start Small.

#### Breakdown of the B = MAP Model:
**B = Behavior:**

This is the specific action you want to perform or the habit you want to create. For example, drinking a glass of water every morning.

**M = Motivation:**

Motivation is the desire to perform a behavior. It can vary in intensity and is influenced by personal goals, rewards, or the fear of negative consequences. However, motivation alone is often not enough because it fluctuates over time.

**A = Ability:**

Ability refers to how easy or difficult it is to perform the behavior. If a behavior is too hard, it’s unlikely to become a habit. Making the behavior simpler and more accessible increases the likelihood of success. For example, placing a glass of water next to your bed makes it easier to drink it in the morning.

**P = Prompt:**

A prompt is a trigger or cue that tells you to perform the behavior. Without a prompt, even if you have high motivation and ability, you might forget to act. An example of a prompt could be an alarm reminding you to drink water in the morning.

### Question 3 : Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior and helps solidify it into a habit. This concept, often referred to as "Shine" in BJ Fogg’s Tiny Habits method, is rooted in the psychology of positive reinforcement.

### Why Celebration Matters:
- Positive Reinforcement:

- Building Emotional Connection:

- Boosting Motivation:

### How to Celebrate:
Celebrations don’t have to be elaborate. Simple, quick actions work best:

- Smile or say “Yes!” out loud.
- Do a little victory dance.
- Give yourself a mental high-five.
- Acknowledge the success with a few positive words.

    " Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, It will multiply whatever you feed it" -James Clear

### Question 6 : Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The core idea is to focus on making incremental changes to your habits

#### Four Laws of Habit Formation:
- Make it obvious: Increase the visibility of your desired habit and make it easy to do.
- Make it attractive: Associate positive feelings and rewards with your desired habit.
- Make it easy: Reduce friction and make it easier to do the desired habit.
- Make it satisfying: Celebrate small wins and make the rewards immediate.



### Question 7 : Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
Atomic Habits primarily focuses on building good habits, but it also provides strategies for breaking bad ones. The key idea is to make the bad habit less attractive, more difficult, and less satisfying.

#### Strategies for Breaking Bad Habits:
- Make it invisible: Reduce exposure to triggers that lead to the bad habit.
- Make it unattractive: Associate negative feelings with the bad habit.
- Make it difficult: Increase the effort required to perform the bad habit.
- Make it unsatisfying: Remove any rewards or positive outcomes associated with the bad habit.


## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

#### Habit: Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) daily

#### Making the Cue Obvious:
- **Schedule:** Dedicate a specific time each day for DSA learning. Put it on your calendar and treat it as a non-negotiable appointment.
- **Create a Dedicated Space:** Designate a specific area or workspace for your DSA studies. This will help you get into the right mindset when you're in that space.
- **Visual Reminders:** Place reminders (sticky notes, posters) around your workspace to keep you focused on your goal.
#### Making the Habit Attractive:
- **Find Motivation:** Identify why learning DSA is important to you. Connect it to your career goals or personal interests.
- **Celebrate Progress:** Reward yourself for completing daily DSA sessions.
- **Join a Community:** Connect with other learners or online communities to share progress and stay motivated.

### Making the Habit Easy:
- **Break it Down:** Divide DSA learning into smaller, manageable tasks. Focus on one concept or problem at a time.
- **Start Small:** Begin with easier problems and gradually increase the difficulty.
- **Use Resources:** Leverage online courses, tutorials, and practice platforms to make learning efficient.
Making the Habit Satisfying:
- **Immediate Feedback:** Practice coding problems and get instant feedback on your solutions.
- **Track Progress:** Use tools or journals to track your learning journey and celebrate milestones.
- **Visualize Success:** Imagine yourself successfully applying DSA concepts in your career or projects.
  

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

#### Habit to Break: Excessive screen time, especially before bed.

#### Making the Cue Invisible:
- **Remove Devices from Bedroom:** Keep your phone, tablet, and laptop outside your bedroom to avoid temptation.
- **Set a Screen-Free Zone:** Designate specific areas of your home as screen-free zones, such as the dining table or bedroom.

#### Making the Process Unattractive:
- **Associate Negative Consequences:** Connect excessive screen time with negative outcomes, such as sleep disturbances or eye strain.
- **Mindful Awareness:** Notice how excessive screen time affects your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being.

#### Making It Difficult:
- **Time Restrictions:** Set limits on screen time, especially before bed. Use parental control apps or browser extensions to enforce these limits.
- **Create Barriers:** Place your devices in a less accessible location to make it harder to reach for them.
